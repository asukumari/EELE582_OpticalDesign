4. a. iii.
	EFL = 20.000
	BFL = 30.000
	f/# = 8.000
4. c.
	We used the marginal ray height solve (M-solve) to find the location
	of the paraxial image plane. In the merit function, we used the EFFL
	operand to optimize the focal length and OPTH/DIFF operands to 
	optimize the back focal length.
	EFL = 19.921
	BFL = 30.052
	t = 15.000
	total track = 47.05223
	rms spot sizes = 15.234, 72.627, 136.459
	These spot sizes do not meet our design goal.
	According to the merit function editor, the astigmatism is the largest
	Siedel aberration.
	W040 = 0.729
	W131 = -1.165
	W222 = 6.836
	W311 = -5.304
	This solution is practical to build, but it does not meet the 
	requirements.
	The ray fans have a cubic shape. The slope is larger in y than x
	which is indicative of astigmatism. The ray fans are neither even
	nor odd functions, which is indicative of coma.
4. d.
	During this optimization cycle, the optimizer was able to recover
	the exact first order optical properites of the system. Furthermore
	we were also able to shrink the off-axis spot sizes by a large
	amount.
	EFL = 20.000
	BFL = 30.000
	t = 15.000
	rms spot sizes = 14.614, 14.544, 14.702
	these spot sizes do not meet our design goal.
	Distortion is the dominant Siedel aberration.
	This is much different than before, the distortion got larger after
	optimization.
	The reason distortion is so large is that we are trying to image over
	a wide field of view. Distortion is cubic in the field angle, so it will
	be large. Furthermore, TRAC does not optimize for distortion.
	W040 = 0.697
	W131 = 1.002
	W222 = -1.042
	W311 = -9.941
	This solution is practical. The lenses do not look too thin or too large.
	The ray fans show a pronounced cubic shape demonstrating spherical 
	aberration. The off-axis fields show a small amount of atigmatism.
4. e.
	Here we used an operand that is new to me, the ABLT operand to constrain
	the distance between the two lenses to be less than 30mm. As in the BFL
	constraint, we used the OPTH and DIFF operands to compute the distance
	between the two surfaces. We then applied the ABLT operand to the result
	of the diff to ensure that the distance stayed less than 30mm. After 
	optimization, we can see that putting the stop in between the lenses
	certainly did help, reducing the RMS spot size at all three field angles.
	EFL = 20.000
	BFL = 30.000
	t = 30.000
	distance from first lens to stop = 23.287
	distance from stop to second lens = 6.713
	rms spot sizes = 8.236   11.091   11.219
	These spot sizes do not meet our design goal.
	Distortion remains the most dominant Siedel aberration.
	W040 = 0.396
	W131 = 1.127
	W222 = -0.572
	W311 = -12.7
	This solution is practical, although the front lens could be too thin to
	support its own weight.
	The spot diagrams exhibit astigmatism in the off-axis fields. The intermediate
	field appears to have more coma than the the outermost field.
4. f.
	In the merit function, we set the weight of the DIFF operand constraining the
	BFL to zero. After running the optimizer, we were dissapointed to see that the
	20 deg. field still did not meet the 10um spot size requirement. We then added 
	a dummy image surface, to allow the optimizer to place the image plane at 
	locations other than the paraxial focus. After rerunning the optimizer with the
	DIS, the spot sizes were reduced significantly. The back focal length is still
	greater than 25mm.
	EFL = 20.000
	BFL = 28.192
	t = 25.118
	track length = 55.3101
	rms spot size = 4.077    5.191    6.906
	These spot sizes do indeed meet our design goal
	distortion is the most dominant Siedel aberration.
	W040 = 0.387
	W131 = 0.727
	W222 = -0.172
	W311 = -11.1
	This solution seems practical, still think the lens is a little thin but its
	most likely ok.
	The on axis spots are almost perfect spherical aberration. The intermediate field
	has pronounced coma in the y-direction. The outermost field is dominated by 
	spherical and distortion.
4. g. 	We hand-optimized the f/# by setting the aperture type to image space f/#, and 
	slowly lower the aperture value while doing optimizations. Using this method, we
	were able to achieve an f/# = 6.73. If we relax the spot size requirement to 15um
	we can achieve an f/# of 5.54.
	Distortion is consistently the biggest problem. This will make the images appear as
	if they have been projected onto a sphere.

	We used the marginal ray height solve (M-solve) to find the location
	of the paraxial image plane. In the merit function, we used the EFFL
	operand to optimize the focal length and OPTH/DIFF operands to 
	optimize the back focal length.
	EFL = 19.921
	BFL = 30.052
	t = 15.000
	total track = 47.05223
	rms spot sizes = 15.234, 72.627, 136.459
	These spot sizes do not meet our design goal.

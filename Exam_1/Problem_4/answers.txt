4. a. iii.
	EFL = 20.000
	BFL = 30.000
	f/# = 8.000
4. c.
	We used the marginal ray height solve (M-solve) to find the location
	of the paraxial image plane. In the merit function, we used the EFFL
	operand to optimize the focal length and OPTH/DIFF operands to 
	optimize the back focal length.
	EFL = 19.921
	BFL = 30.052
	t = 15.000
	total track = 47.05223
	rms spot sizes = 15.234, 72.627, 136.459
	These spot sizes do not meet our design goal.
	According to the merit function editor, the astigmatism is the largest
	Siedel aberration.
	W040 = 0.729
	W131 = -1.165
	W222 = 6.836
	W311 = -5.304
	This solution is practical to build, but it does not meet the 
	requirements.
	The ray fans have a cubic shape. The slope is larger in y than x
	which is indicative of astigmatism. The ray fans are neither even
	nor odd functions, which is indicative of coma.
4. d.
	During this optimization cycle, the optimizer was able to recover
	the exact first order optical properites of the system. Furthermore
	we were also able to shrink the off-axis spot sizes by a large
	amount.
	EFL = 20.000
	BFL = 30.000
	t = 15.000
	rms spot sizes = 14.614, 14.544, 14.702
	these spot sizes do not meet our design goal.
	Distortion is the dominant Siedel aberration.
	This is much different than before, the distortion got larger after
	optimization.
	The reason distortion is so large is that we are trying to image over
	a wide field of view. Distortion is cubic in the field angle, so it will
	be large. Furthermore, TRAC does not optimize for distortion.
	W040 = 0.697
	W131 = 1.002
	W222 = -1.042
	W311 = -9.941
	This solution is practical. The lenses do not look too thin or too large.
	The ray fans show a pronounced cubic shape demonstrating spherical 
	aberration. The off-axis fields show a small amount of atigmatism.

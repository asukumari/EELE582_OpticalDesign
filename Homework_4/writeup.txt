-Calculate the curvature of the lens using equation given in class.

ZEMAX

-In the Aperature section of the System Explorer, 
--set the aperature type to be Image Space F/# (LEARNED)
--Set the aperature value to 15
--This should allow the Clear Semi-Dia of the surfaces to float according to F/#.

-In the Fields section of the System Explorer
--Keep Field 1 at the default values
--Activate and set the Y-value of Field 2 to be 10.5
--Activate and set the Y-value of Field 3 to be 15.0
--This configuration will allow us to compare the RMS spot sizes to the targets given by Geary.

-In the Wavelengths section of the System Explorer
--Set Wavelength 1 to 0.587 um.


-In the Lens Data Editor
--Enter a dummy surface to see the incoming rays (LEARNED), with a thickness of 30mm.
---In the Draw section of the Surface 1 properties we check 'Do Not Draw This Surface'.
----This will allow us to see the incoming rays without the confusion of a surface.

--Set the front of the lens to positive curvature, BK7 glass and a thickness of 4mm
---Set the curvature ot the lens to be a variable

--Set the back of the lens to negative curvature and have the thickness be f/2 (50mm)
---Set the curvature and thickness of the lens to be a variable

--Set the thickness of the Stop to solve for the marginal ray height and set this height to be 0.
---This should place the image plane in the location of the paraxial focus.
---There should be and `M' next to the thickness value.

--Create a dummy image surface with the thickness initally set to zero and set as a variable
---This will allow the optimizer to incorporate defocus from the paraxial focus
---In the Surface 5 Properties check 'Do Not Draw This Surface' and 'Skip Rays To This Surface'.
----This is to avoid cluttering the layout with rays extending beyond the image plane

-In the layout we should see the two lens surfaces overlappingterawave


-In the Merit Function Editor
--Use the optimization wizard to set the Type to RMS and the Reference to Centroid.
--Add the EFFL operand with a Target of 100 and a weight of 1
---This will set the effective focal length to 100mm.
--Add the MXCA operand, set Surf1 and Surf2 to 3 (the back of the lens), and set the Target to 100 and the weight to 1.0
--Add the MNCA operand, set Surf1 and Surf2 to 3 (the back of the lens), and set the Target to 0.0 and the weight to 1.0
---This allows the stop to float anywhere between the back of the lens to the image plane.

-Optimize the layout, and the result should be a meniscus shaped lens with the stop about 10mm from the back of the lens.
